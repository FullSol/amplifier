Tentative Project Timeline: 



### Decisions 

External API: (Games and Comics) [_Diablo III_](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/getting-started) 

### Diablo III Fansite 
**What do we want to focus our fansite on based on the Diablo III theme?** 
- View the rankings (You don't need to be logged in for that)
- adding screen shots (allowing posting, 1 layer comments)
    - don't want to track comments on top of comments on top of replies, etc 
    - this will force us to use a blob, bytea

AVOID: 
- User board 
    - complicated -> need to have a comment system, users linking into that, replies to people, doPost, etc.
